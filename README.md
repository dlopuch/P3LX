P3LX
====

P3LX is a Processing 3 wrapper library for the [LX](https://github.com/heronarts/LX) lighting engine and the basis of the [LX Studio](http://lx.studio/) application. It allows you to simply embed LX inside a Processing sketch with a rich UI library that makes rendering a 3-D model simulation with overlayed 2-D controls easy and painless.

The simplest way to start is by downloading this repository and making a copy of the [examples/LXStudioDemo](https://github.com/heronarts/P3LX/tree/master/examples/LXStudioDemo) Processing sketch for your own project.

P3LX is made available under the GPLv2 with special linking exceptions that permit the use of [CoreMidi4J](https://github.com/DerekCook/CoreMidi4J) (which improves MIDI support on OSX - thanks Derek!) and [google-gson](https://github.com/google/gson). If this licensing is obstructive to your needs, you may contact me to discuss dual-licensing.

Building a big cool project? I'm probably interested in hearing about it! Drop me a line: mark@heronarts.com
